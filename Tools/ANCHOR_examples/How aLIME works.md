### Introduction to aLIME
Anchor Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (aLIME) is a methodology for providing transparent and understandable explanations of predictions made by machine learning models. This approach uses if-then rules as anchors that guarantee the prediction remains stable despite changes in other input features, and is applicable to any model, hence being model-agnostic.

### Key Concepts of aLIME
- **Anchors**: These are specific rules or conditions derived from the input features that, when met, ensure the prediction outcome is constant, effectively "anchoring" the prediction.
- **Model-Agnostic**: aLIME does not require any knowledge of the internal workings of the model. It treats the model as a black box, focusing on the input and output relationship.
- **Local Explanation**: The explanations are local to each prediction instance, meaning they explain why the model made a specific prediction for an individual input.

### Mathematical Description

#### Precision of an Anchor
The precision of an anchor is defined as the probability that the prediction remains the same when the conditions specified by the anchor are met. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

$$\text{Precision}(f, x, c, D) = E_D(z \mid c,x) [1_{f(x)=f(z)}]$$

Where:
- $f$ represents the model.
- $x$ is the instance being explained.
- $c$ is the set of conditions that form the anchor.
- $D$ is the distribution of data, and $z$ are instances from $D$ that meet the conditions $c$.

#### Optimization Problem
The goal is to find the smallest possible anchor that ensures a high precision. This is formulated as an optimization problem:
$$\min_{c \subseteq C_x} |c| \text{ such that } \text{Precision}(f, x, c, D) \geq 1 - \epsilon$$
Here, $\epsilon$ is a small value representing the tolerance for error, and $C_x$ is the set of all possible conditions derivable from the instance $x$.

### Algorithmic Approach

#### Sampling and Approximation
Direct computation of the precision for every possible anchor is computationally expensive and impractical. Therefore, the precision is approximated using sampling methods where instances $z$ are drawn from the distribution $D$ conditioned on the anchor $c$.

#### Greedy Optimization
To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a greedy algorithm is used:
1. Start with no conditions in the anchor.
2. Iteratively add the condition that most improves the precision estimate until the precision requirement is met.
3. Use Hoeffding Bounds to statistically validate the precision improvement by each condition, minimizing the sample size needed for reliable estimates.


### Example: Loan Approval Model

**Scenario**:
Imagine we have a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a loan should be approved or not. The model takes two input features: credit score and income level. For simplicity, let's assume the model outputs a binary decision: approve or deny.

#### Model's Behavior:
- Approve the loan if:
  - Credit score > 700
  - Income level > \$50,000

Otherwise, the loan is denied.

#### Instance to Explain:
Let's consider an individual application with the following attributes:
- Credit score: 720
- Income level: \$55,000

The model approves this loan.

### Task:
Identify an anchor that explains this decision.

### Anchor Identification Process:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Model prediction for the instance $f(x) = 	Approve$.
   - We aim to find conditions (anchors) under which the prediction remains 'Approve'.

2. **Potential Anchors**:
   - Anchor 1: Credit score > 700
   - Anchor 2: Income level > $50,000
   - Anchor 3: Both Credit score > 700 and Income level > $50,000

3. **Testing Anchors**:
   - For Anchor 1: Vary income level while keeping credit score > 700.
     - Test with income = \$30,000 and income = \$60,000.
     - **Prediction changes to 'Deny' when income falls below \$50,000.**
     - This indicates that Anchor 1 alone does not fully explain the decision.
   - For Anchor 2: Vary credit score while keeping income > \$50,000.
     - Test with credit score = 650 and credit score = 710.
     - **Prediction changes to 'Deny' when credit score drops below 700.**
     - This indicates that Anchor 2 alone does not fully explain the decision.
   - For Anchor 3: Vary neither credit score nor income level (both conditions are maintained).
     - Prediction remains 'Approve' consistently, confirming that both conditions are required.

4. **Choosing the Best Anchor**:
   - **Anchor 3 (Both Credit score > 700 and Income level > $50,000)** is the valid anchor as the prediction remains stable ('Approve') only when both conditions are satisfied.
   - **Anchor 1 (Credit score > 700)** and **Anchor 2 (Income level > $50,000)** do not independently secure the 'Approve' prediction when the other condition varies.

### Conclusion:
In this example, the anchor "Both Credit score > 700 and Income level > $50,000" sufficiently explains why the loan is approved. This anchor is minimal (simple enough) and has high precision, fulfilling the requirements of an effective explanation.
